The image contains a large table. Please extract the information from that in tabular format. Include all columns, even those consisting only of zeros, but do not include the header rows. Be sure to include all columns, even duplicated ones. The table always contains 18 columns. Make sure to extract all 18 columns. If the extracted data does not contain 18 columns, re-extract the table. The first column of the table contains numbers or missing values, the second column contains texts. Make sure to extract these columns too. There is a string in the upper left hand corner, add it to all rows of the table as the first column. Only use the first line. There is a string in the upper right hand corner, which always starts with the string "Intézetkód :", followed by four characters. Add those four characters (even the leading zero or zeros) to all rows of the table as the second column. The information extracted from the table should start in the third column. Provide the response in CSV format. Use ; as a column separator.
